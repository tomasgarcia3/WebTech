      This is a paragraph. I've tried to make it long enough to scroll onto a
      second line. If it's still two short, please resize your window so that
      you can observe whether or not it's indented properly.

    <p class='change-font'>
      This is the second paragraph. Note that it has exactly the same style as
      the first paragraph. You will need to learn how to use in-line styles or
      tag ids if you want this paragraph to be formatted differently from the
      one above.
